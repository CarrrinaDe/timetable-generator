# timetable-generator
Timetable generator using logical paradigm programming

I wrote in Prolog a timetable generator, like the one for college courses.

Constraints to be satisfied:
- logical: two individuals can not teach at the same time in two different places, two different activities can not take place in the same room at the same time etc.
- preferential: for example, somebody likes to have morning classes, or no breaks between classes etc.
